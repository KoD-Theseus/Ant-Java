    CombatTaskPriority
CombatGroup
    Role assignment
        Skill-based
        Increase experience in role
            Time-based
            Task Completion
    Combat Detection
        Place into nearby combatGroup on detect
            Init new combatGroup if none found nearby
        Weight Survival
            Quantity
            Quality (estimated)
                different scaling for approximation based on unit type and species
            terrain
            Knowledge
    Task List
        Create priorities for units within combatGroup
            Assign tasks with relation to caste, species, skill, location, and some randomness
Pheromones
     Fluid-based
        Typically for trails and such
        Create gases
     Gas-based
        Disperses faster, immediately gaseous
     Territorial
        Fluid-based almost always
        May cause aggression in species not aligned with the pheromone.
